//|                        Matrix GUI v2                                     |**
//| OVERVIEW                                                                 |**
//|	Matrix GUI v2 is a replacement for the original Matrix GUI that      |**
//| shipped with the TI SDK. Whereas the previous version was written in C   |**
//| and built on Qt, Matrix GUI v2 is written almost entirely in javascript. |**
//| It also offers several improvements over its predecessor:                |**
//| 	1) Remote Access. Matrix Gui v2 may be remotely accessed from any    |**
//|        computer on the same network as the board on which it is running. |**
//|        When remotely accessed, Matrix GUI may be used to launch apps,    |**
//|        view their descriptions, and stream text output back to the       |**
//|        remote user.                                                      |**
//|     2) Simplicity of adding apps. Adding an app to Matrix GUI v2 is as   |**
//|        simple as dragging and dropping a file into a directory. Matrix   |**
//|        GUI v2 scans the apps directory and dynamically builds app lists, |**
//|        eliminating the need for human maintained lists.                  |**
//|     3) Portability. Matrix GUI v2 is written in Javascript and built on  |**
//|        nodejs. Thus, it will run on any platform that supports nodejs    |**
//|        without needing to be modified or compiled. Its client portion    |**
//|        will run in nearly any modern browser supporting HTML5 and        |**
//|        Javascript.                                                       |**
//|                                                                          |**
//| ARCHITECTURE                                                             |**
//| 	Matrix GUI v2 is designed around a client-server model more commonly |**
//| associated with a web site. This is what allows remote access from web   |**
//| browsers using the same code that it uses when it is running locally.    |**
//|                                                                          |**
//| SERVER                                                                   |**
//|	The server portion of matrix is made up of server.js and the files   |**
//| in the lib/ folder in matrix root. It is responsible for:                |**
//|	1) Parsing manifest files. Manifest files are based on the desktop   |**
//|        entry standard maintained by freedesktop.org. The spec may be     |**
//|        http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/       |**
